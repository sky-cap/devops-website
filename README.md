The purpose of this repository is to practice and learn skills related to DevOps and automation of the SDLC.
The contents of this website are not as important as the background steps taken when updating and managing this site. 

This site was created locally first - followed by initializing a git repository via the shell.
After that a remote connection was made to my GitHub account and pushed up to the main branch.
Git Pages was setup to host the site for quick management.

No errors occured during the setup - smooth as butter so far!
